1. Introduction to the Fibonacci Sequence

Definition and Formula
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Mathematically: 
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with initial values F(0) =0 and F(1) =1
The sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.


2. Origins and Historical Background

Fibonacci and the Rabbit Problem
The sequence is named after Leonardo of Pisa, or Fibonacci, who introduced it in his 1202 book Liber Abaci. He used it to model rabbit population growth, leading to the discovery of a recurring pattern in nature.

Significance in Mathematics
Since its discovery, the Fibonacci sequence has fascinated mathematicians and found relevance across fields like biology, art, finance, and computing.


3. Mathematical Representation

Recursive Formula
The Fibonacci sequence is often defined recursively: 
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Closed-Form Solution (Binet's Formula)
A non-recursive formula known as Binet's Formula approximates the nth Fibonacci number:
F(n) = (∅^n-〖 (1- ∅)〗^n)/√5
  where ø (phi) represents the Golden Ratio, approximately 1.618.
