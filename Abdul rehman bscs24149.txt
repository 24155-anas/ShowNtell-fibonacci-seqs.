Fibonacci sequence : 
A fibonacci sequence is a sequence followed by every other element in nature like flower petals , sunflower seeds and in many fields its use is very essential .
Obtained :
It is a sequence of numbers that starts with 0 and 1 and the so on is obtained by adding the two previous one’s for instance : 
0 ,1, 1, 2, 3, 5,8,12 ….. Have you noticed that a sequence following this sequence is essential for us as it is the use of today .  
Relation with discrete mathematics : 
It is connected with discrete math through concepts like recurrence relations , combinatorics and even graph theory.
Recurrence relation : 
The fibonacci sequence is a classical relation  example of the recurrence relation because it uses the previous terms to describe the upcoming terms and recurrence relation is such that it uses the previous terms to generate a new one .
Look at this expression : 
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) 
This eq is a recursive relation because it describes a way to show f(n) in terms of the previous numbers .
Code example : 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


// Recursive function to calculate Fibonacci sequence
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n; // Base cases: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2); // Recursive relation
}




int main( ) {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number to find its Fibonacci value: ";
    cin >> n;


    // Calculate Fibonacci and display the result
    cout << "Fibonacci(" << n << ") = " << fibonacci(n) << endl;


    return 0;
}
THE OUTPUT : 
This code gives the number at which the number you entered is in that place in the fibonacci sequence .
This code is the foundation of the eq defined at the upper part .
Recursion

Recursion is simply a prouss where calls itself problems. function to solve sub

diser diserele maths, it is In discrete - a way Je affine motions, sequences or function Structures sules that by specifying nelaie each term or element to previous one In simple it is essentia for defining se algonitin's sequences, Cond structure's in discrete math, as it capture problem with repititine self - similar pattern.

Base case

In simple words, it is case that tells the a function to stop calling fself. We need case 'so thai does not terminate Our function crashes or do when the base condition is meet.

Recurrsine 3-

In this case the function continous te call it sell sinless and untill it receive a base condition.
For example- Facionial Functions- Let consider that in this function our base case is O! =1 Base

Recursive case 3- n! n(n-1)!

Here any 3 com be mum ben which want the fictorial each X by the you This means that fictorialn! is previous fictorial. num ber ろじ

Suppose the fictorial which we want is 4 then it will goes as follows

ul 41 = 4 x 31

312321

11 = 1201

0! = 1

Plugging backs

1! 1

2! 2×1=2

3! 2 3x2.6

4.6 = 24 So fictorial of 4 is 24
